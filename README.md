# README

Build and deploy docker image:

`docker compose up --build`

or if it's already built:
`docker compose up`

rails server will be on port 3000
React app is on port 4000


`docker exec -it rr-template-backend-1 bash`
to bash into a file

`docker ps` to get container name ^^




## Frontend

Frontend uses Redux toolkit - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/rtk-query


yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd frontend
  yarn start

For authenticated pages, run a GET request before each call:
get '/current_user'
^^ this will return a 200 if the user is validated


## Backend
We can access user serializer data for single record by:

UserSerializer.new(resource).serializable_hash[:data][:attributes].to_json
And multiple records by,
UserSerializer.new(resource).serializable_hash[:data].map{|data| data[:attributes].to_json}


We use: https://github.com/jsonapi-serializer/jsonapi-serializer
